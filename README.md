# OpenGL_Tutorials_DSU
Accompanying git repo for the OpenGL Tutorials at DSU. This is targetting beginners esp. undergraduate students from DSU 
or any other university for that matter as long as the intent is to learn basic computer graphics in C/C++.

These tutorials are bound to my lectures taken each Tuesday. Each week, exercise will be given and the next week the 
exercise solution will be given for active learning.
